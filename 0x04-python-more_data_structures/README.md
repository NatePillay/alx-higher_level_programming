README for new task

Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
matrix is a 2 dimensional array
Returns a new matrix:
Same size as matrix
Each value should be the square of the value of the input
Initial matrix should not be modified
You are not allowed to import any module
You are allowed to use regular loops, map, 

Sure, here's an implementation of the requested function:

python
Copy code
def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
    # Create a new matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix
    result_matrix = [[0 for j in range(len(matrix[i]))] for i in range(len(matrix))]
    
    # Square each integer in the input matrix and store the result in the corresponding cell of the result matrix
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
            result_matrix[i][j] = matrix[i][j] ** 2
    
    return result_matrix
This function takes a matrix as input and returns a new matrix where each value is the square of the corresponding value in the input matrix. The function creates a new matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix and then uses nested loops to square each integer in the input matrix and store the result in the corresponding cell of the new matrix. Finally, the function returns the new matrix.

#!/usr/bin/python3
def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
    return [list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, row)) for row in matrix]

Yes, that implementation works as well! It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each row in the input matrix and applies a lambda function that squares each value in the row using the map() function. The resulting list of squared values is converted to a list using the list() function and added to a new matrix using another list comprehension. Finally, the new matrix is returned.

This implementation has the advantage of being more concise than the previous one I provided, as it uses list comprehensions and map() to perform the necessary operations. However, it may be less clear to readers who are not familiar with these constructs, so it's always a good idea to write code that is easy to read and understand.

please explain the map and list functions

Certainly!

map() is a built-in Python function that applies a given function to each element of an iterable (such as a list, tuple, or dictionary) and returns an iterator of the results. The syntax for map() is as follows:

python
Copy code
map(function, iterable)
The function parameter is the function to apply to each element of the iterable, and the iterable parameter is the iterable to apply the function to. The map() function returns an iterator of the results, which can be converted to a list or other data structure if desired.

For example, consider the following code:

python
Copy code
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_list = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, my_list))
print(squared_list)
In this code, map() is used to apply a lambda function that squares each element of the my_list list. The resulting iterator is then converted to a list using the list() function and stored in the squared_list variable. The output of the code is [1, 4, 9, 16, 25], which is the list of squared values.

list() is a built-in Python function that converts an iterable (such as a tuple or iterator) to a list. The syntax for list() is simply:

python
Copy code
list(iterable)
For example, consider the following code:

python
Copy code
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
my_list = list(my_tuple)
print(my_list)
In this code, list() is used to convert the my_tuple tuple to a list. The resulting list is then printed, and the output is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
