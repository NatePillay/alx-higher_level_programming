c = db.cursor()

The line c = db.cursor() creates a cursor object that allows you to interact with the database in Python code. A cursor is a control structure that allows you to traverse and manipulate the records of a database.

Once you have a cursor object, you can use it to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the database. The cursor provides several methods for working with the database, including:

execute(query, args=None): Executes a SQL query and returns the number of affected rows (for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements) or None (for SELECT statements).

fetchone(): Fetches the next row from the result set returned by the previous SELECT statement.

fetchall(): Fetches all rows from the result set returned by the previous SELECT statement.

fetchmany(size=None): Fetches the next set of rows from the result set returned by the previous SELECT statement, up to a maximum of size rows.

close(): Closes the cursor and releases any resources it is holding.

In the context of your code, the line c = db.cursor() creates a cursor object that you can use to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the db connection. You can then use the cursor to execute a query to retrieve all the rows from the states table, and fetch the results using one of the cursor's fetch methods.

declarative_base

declarative_base is a function provided by the SQLAlchemy library for Python, which is used to create a base class that can be used to define declarative classes.

Declarative classes are a way of defining database tables and their relationships using Python classes instead of SQL statements. They allow developers to define database schema using an object-oriented syntax, which can make the code easier to read and maintain.

The declarative_base function returns a new base class for declarative classes to inherit from. When defining a new declarative class, the developer can subclass this base class and define the table and its columns as attributes of the class.

For example, here is a simple example of how declarative_base can be used to define a table called User:

sql
Copy code
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'users'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    age = Column(Integer)
In this example, declarative_base is called to create a base class Base, which is then subclassed to define the User class. The __tablename__ attribute specifies the name of the database table, and the Column objects define the columns of the table.

    db_uri = 'mysql+mysqldb://{}:{}@localhost:3306/{}'.format(
        argv[1], argv[2], argv[3])
    engine = create_engine(db_uri)
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

The code you provided is a Python code snippet that sets up a database connection using the SQLAlchemy library for Python.

The db_uri variable contains a connection string that specifies the database to connect to, the username and password to use for authentication, and the driver to use for the database. In this case, the driver is mysql+mysqldb, indicating that the database is a MySQL database.

The values for the username, password, and database name are taken from the command line arguments argv[1], argv[2], and argv[3], respectively. These values are passed into the connection string using Python's format() method.

The create_engine() function is then used to create a database engine object based on the connection string. The engine object is responsible for connecting to the database and executing SQL queries.

Finally, the sessionmaker() function is used to create a session factory object that is bound to the engine. The session factory is responsible for creating new sessions that can be used to query and modify the database. The bind argument specifies the engine to use for connecting to the database.

Once the engine and session factory are created, they can be used to interact with the database by creating and using SQLAlchemy's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) objects, such as declarative classes, which can represent tables and their relationships as Python classes.
