c = db.cursor()

The line c = db.cursor() creates a cursor object that allows you to interact with the database in Python code. A cursor is a control structure that allows you to traverse and manipulate the records of a database.

Once you have a cursor object, you can use it to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the database. The cursor provides several methods for working with the database, including:

execute(query, args=None): Executes a SQL query and returns the number of affected rows (for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements) or None (for SELECT statements).

fetchone(): Fetches the next row from the result set returned by the previous SELECT statement.

fetchall(): Fetches all rows from the result set returned by the previous SELECT statement.

fetchmany(size=None): Fetches the next set of rows from the result set returned by the previous SELECT statement, up to a maximum of size rows.

close(): Closes the cursor and releases any resources it is holding.

In the context of your code, the line c = db.cursor() creates a cursor object that you can use to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the db connection. You can then use the cursor to execute a query to retrieve all the rows from the states table, and fetch the results using one of the cursor's fetch methods.
