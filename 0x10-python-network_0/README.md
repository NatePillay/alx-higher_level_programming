curl options http

The curl command is a popular tool for transferring data over the internet. Here are some common options that can be used with curl when working with HTTP:

-X or --request: specifies the HTTP method to use (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
-H or --header: allows you to specify HTTP headers to include in the request
-d or --data: sends data in the request body (usually used with POST or PUT requests)
-G or --get: sends a GET request (this is the default method if no method is specified)
-i or --include: includes the response headers in the output
-o or --output: saves the output to a file instead of printing it to the terminal
-u or --user: specifies the username and password for HTTP authentication
-v or --verbose: enables verbose output, which includes information about the request and response
Here's an example of using curl with some of these options to send a GET request to a website:

bash
Copy code
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" https://example.com/api/v1/resources
This command sends a GET request to https://example.com/api/v1/resources, includes an Accept header with a value of application/json, and includes the response headers in the output.

What is the curl option to set a cookie with a key-value pair?

The -b or --cookie option can be used to set a cookie with a key-value pair in curl. Here's the syntax:

arduino
Copy code
curl -b "key=value" URL
This command sets a cookie with the name key and value value. You can set multiple cookies by separating them with semicolons like this:

arduino
Copy code
curl -b "key1=value1; key2=value2" URL
In this example, two cookies are set: one with the name key1 and value value1, and another with the name key2 and value value2.

Note that if you want to add a cookie to an existing cookie jar file, you can use the -b option to read in the cookies from the file, and the -c option to write the updated cookies back to the file. Here's an example:

css
Copy code
curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt URL
This command reads in the cookies from the cookies.txt file, sends a request to URL, and writes any updated cookies back to the same file.

what is a sub domain in a web address

In a web address or URL, a subdomain is a domain that is part of a larger domain. It is a way to organize and differentiate different sections or functions of a website.

A subdomain is separated from the main domain by a dot (.) and is placed before the main domain name in a URL. For example, in the URL https://subdomain.example.com, subdomain is the subdomain and example.com is the main domain.

Subdomains are often used to create separate areas for different purposes of a website. For example, a company might use the subdomain blog.example.com for their blog, or shop.example.com for their online store. They can also be used to create separate sites for different countries or languages, such as fr.example.com for a French version of a website.

Subdomains can be registered and managed independently from the main domain. They can also have their own separate DNS records and server configurations.

What is the curl option to set a body key-value parameter?

The -d or --data option can be used to set a body key-value parameter in curl. Here's the syntax:

arduino
Copy code
curl -d "key=value" URL
This command sends an HTTP POST request with the body parameter key set to value. You can set multiple key-value pairs by separating them with ampersands (&) like this:

arduino
Copy code
curl -d "key1=value1&key2=value2" URL
In this example, two body parameters are set: one with the key key1 and value value1, and another with the key key2 and value value2.

Note that curl uses HTTP GET requests by default. If you want to use a POST request, you need to specify it using the -X or --request option like this:

arduino
Copy code
curl -X POST -d "key=value" URL
This command sends an HTTP POST request with the body parameter key set to value.

What’s the status code number for a permanent redirection (moved permanently)?

The status code number for a permanent redirection (moved permanently) is 301.

When a server responds with a 301 Moved Permanently status code, it indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location. The client should update its bookmarks or links to the old location and use the new URL provided in the response for any future requests to the resource.

The 301 status code is often used for URLs that have permanently moved to a new domain name or URL structure. For example, if a website changes its domain name, it might use a 301 redirect to automatically send users and search engines to the new domain.

In addition to the 301 status code, there are several other HTTP status codes related to redirection, including 302 Found (temporary redirection) and 307 Temporary Redirect (temporary redirection, preserved method).

What’s the status code number for an invalid HTTP request (server can’t understand it)?

The status code number for an invalid HTTP request (server can't understand it) is 400 Bad Request.

When a server responds with a 400 Bad Request status code, it indicates that the request sent by the client was malformed or invalid in some way and could not be understood by the server. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as missing or incorrect parameters, malformed syntax, or unsupported methods or headers.

The 400 status code is one of several HTTP status codes related to client errors. Other client error codes include 401 Unauthorized (authentication required), 403 Forbidden (access denied), and 404 Not Found (requested resource not found).

What is the name of the HTTP response header used to define the size, in bytes, of the body of the response?

The name of the HTTP response header used to define the size, in bytes, of the body of the response is Content-Length.

The Content-Length header is used to specify the length of the content body in bytes, so that the client knows how much data to expect and can allocate the appropriate amount of memory to receive the response. The header is included in the response message only when the length of the response body is known in advance.

For example, a response message might include a Content-Length header like this:

php
Copy code
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 1024

<html>
<head>
<title>Example Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an example page.</p>
</body>
</html>
In this example, the Content-Length header indicates that the response body is 1024 bytes long.

What is the name of the HTTP response header used to send cookies to the client from the server?



The name of the HTTP response header used to send cookies to the client from the server is Set-Cookie.

The Set-Cookie header is used to send a cookie from the server to the client. It is included in an HTTP response message when the server wants to create or modify a cookie stored on the client. The header contains the name and value of the cookie, as well as optional attributes such as the expiration time, domain, and path.

Here's an example of a Set-Cookie header:

javascript
Copy code
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Set-Cookie: name=value; expires=Wed, 21 Apr 2023 07:28:00 GMT; path=/

<html>
<head>
<title>Example Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an example page.</p>
</body>
</html>
In this example, the Set-Cookie header sets a cookie named "name" with the value "value". It also includes optional attributes such as the expiration time and path. The client will store this cookie and include it in subsequent requests to the same domain and path.

curl command -L

The curl -L command is used to follow HTTP redirects. The -L option tells curl to follow any redirect responses that it receives from the server.

Here's an example:

arduino
Copy code
curl -L https://www.example.com
In this example, curl will request the URL https://www.example.com and follow any redirects until it reaches the final destination. This is useful when a website has moved to a new URL or when a page has been temporarily or permanently redirected to another location.

By default, curl will only show the response for the final destination after following redirects. To see the response for all intermediate destinations as well, you can use the -i option:

arduino
Copy code
curl -L -i https://www.example.com
This command will show the HTTP response headers for all intermediate and final destinations.

What is the name of the HTTP response header used to define the formatting of the body? (This header gives details to the client on how to interpret the data received.)

The name of the HTTP response header used to define the formatting of the body is Content-Type.

The Content-Type header is used to specify the format of the data in the response body, so that the client knows how to interpret the data it receives. The header is included in the response message and typically contains a MIME type that describes the format of the data.

For example, a response message might include a Content-Type header like this:

php
Copy code
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

<html>
<head>
<title>Example Page</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This is an example page.</p>
</body>
</html>
In this example, the Content-Type header indicates that the response body is formatted as HTML. Other common MIME types include application/json, text/plain, and image/png.

In the following URL, what’s the hostname?

http://www.google.com

In the URL http://www.google.com, the hostname is www.google.com.

The hostname is the part of a URL that identifies the server that the client wants to connect to. It typically consists of a domain name and a top-level domain, separated by a dot. In this case, www is a subdomain of the google.com domain, which is a top-level domain.

The hostname is used by the client to initiate a connection to the server, and is typically included in the HTTP Host header in subsequent requests. The server uses the hostname to determine which website or application the client is requesting, if it is hosting multiple websites or applications on the same IP address.

What is the first digit of status codes that indicate a server error?

The first digit of status codes that indicate a server error is 5.

HTTP status codes starting with 5 indicate that the server encountered an error while processing the request, and was unable to fulfill the request as a result. These codes are server-side errors, meaning that the problem is with the server or the application running on the server, rather than with the client or the request itself.

The most common server error status codes are:

500 Internal Server Error: Indicates a generic server error that doesn't provide any specific information about the cause of the error.
502 Bad Gateway: Indicates that the server acting as a gateway or proxy received an invalid response from an upstream server.
503 Service Unavailable: Indicates that the server is currently unable to handle the request due to maintenance or temporary overloading.
504 Gateway Timeout: Indicates that the server acting as a gateway or proxy did not receive a response from an upstream server within a specified time limit.

What is the curl option to save the body of the resulting response to a file?

The curl option to save the body of the resulting response to a file is -o or --output.

You can use the -o option followed by the name of the file you want to save the output to. For example:

arduino
Copy code
curl -o output.txt http://example.com
This command will send a GET request to http://example.com and save the body of the response to the file output.txt. If the file already exists, curl will overwrite it. If you want to append the output to an existing file instead, you can use the -a or --append option instead of -o.

You can also use the --output option followed by the name of the file you want to save the output to. For example:

arduino
Copy code
curl --output output.txt http://example.com
This command is equivalent to the previous one.

 When you are typing https://intranet.hbtn.io in your browser, which HTTP verb is used?

When typing https://intranet.hbtn.io in a browser, no HTTP verb is used in the URL directly.

The HTTP verb is actually determined by the browser based on the type of request being made. When typing a URL into the browser, it sends a GET request by default. This is the HTTP verb used to request the server for the web page located at the specified URL. The server then responds with a response message containing the requested web page, which the browser displays to the user.

However, it's important to note that the HTTP verb used may change depending on the type of action being performed on the page. For example, if a form is submitted on the page using a POST request, then the HTTP verb used for that request will be POST.

What is the name of the HTTP request header used to send cookies from the client?

The name of the HTTP request header used to send cookies from the client is Cookie.

When a server sets a cookie in the response, the client stores the cookie and sends it back to the server with subsequent requests. The cookie is sent in the Cookie header, which contains one or more name-value pairs separated by semicolons. Each name-value pair represents a single cookie.

Here's an example of an HTTP request header that includes a Cookie header:

vbnet
Copy code
GET /example HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Cookie: sessionid=123456789
In this example, the client is sending a GET request to www.example.com and including a Cookie header that contains a single cookie with the name sessionid and the value 123456789. The server can use this information to identify the client and maintain session state between requests.

In the following URL, what’s the resource path?

The resource path in a URL is the part of the URL that identifies the specific resource being requested from the server. It typically follows the hostname and the optional port number, and begins with a forward slash /.

In the following URL:

ruby
Copy code
http://www.example.com/products/widgets/green
The resource path is:

bash
Copy code
/products/widgets/green
This path identifies a specific resource on the server, in this case a green widget product. The server can use the resource path to determine how to handle the request and return the appropriate response to the client.

Which HTTP request header indicates the browser used by the client sending the request?


Browser-Name


User-Agent


I-Am


Origin

The HTTP request header that indicates the browser used by the client sending the request is User-Agent.

The User-Agent header is included in the HTTP request sent by the client to the server, and it contains information about the client's browser and operating system. This header is used by the server to determine the capabilities of the client and to tailor the response accordingly.

Here is an example of an HTTP request header that includes a User-Agent header:

sql
Copy code
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/87.0.4280.141 Safari/537.36
In this example, the User-Agent header indicates that the client is using the Chrome web browser on a Windows 10 operating system.

What will be the port number requested by this URL?

afp://www.google.com/access_in_port_543

The URL afp://www.google.com/access_in_port_543 specifies the protocol afp and the hostname www.google.com. However, it doesn't specify a port number.

If no port number is specified in a URL for a given protocol, the default port number for that protocol is used. In this case, since the afp protocol is being used, the default port number is 548.

So the full URL with the default port number would be:

bash
Copy code
afp://www.google.com:548/access_in_port_543
Note that this URL is unlikely to work, since Google does not provide access via the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP).

where do we specify the port number in URL with an example

In a URL, the port number is typically specified immediately after the hostname, separated by a colon (:), before the resource path.

For example, if you want to request a webpage using the HTTP protocol on port 8080 of the server with the hostname www.example.com, you would use the following URL:

bash
Copy code
http://www.example.com:8080/path/to/resource
In this example, the port number 8080 is specified after the hostname www.example.com and before the resource path /path/to/resource. This tells the client to send the request to the server on port 8080, instead of the default port number for HTTP, which is 80.

Note that not all protocols require a port number to be specified. For example, the default port number for HTTPS is 443, so if you want to request a secure webpage using HTTPS on port 443, you can use the following URL:

ruby
Copy code
https://www.example.com/path/to/resource
In this case, the port number does not need to be specified because it is the default for the HTTPS protocol.

Write a Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a request to that URL, and displays the size of the body of the response

The size must be displayed in bytes
You have to use curl

Here's a Bash script that takes a URL as input, sends a request to that URL using curl, and displays the size of the body of the response in bytes:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Check that a URL has been provided as an argument
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <URL>"
    exit 1
fi

# Send a request to the URL using curl and save the response to a temporary file
response=$(curl -s -w "%{size_download}" -o /tmp/response.txt "$1")

# Display the size of the response body in bytes
echo "Response size: $response bytes"
Here's how the script works:

It checks that a URL has been provided as an argument to the script. If not, it displays a usage message and exits with an error code.
It sends a request to the URL using curl with the -s option to silence the progress meter and the -w option to specify a custom output format for the response. The %{size_download} format specifier is used to print the size of the response body in bytes. The -o option is used to save the response to a temporary file at /tmp/response.txt.
It reads the size of the response body from the output of the curl command and stores it in the response variable.
It displays the size of the response body in bytes.
You can save this script to a file, e.g. check_response_size.sh, and make it executable with chmod +x check_response_size.sh. You can then run it with a URL as an argument, e.g. ./check_response_size.sh https://www.example.com.
